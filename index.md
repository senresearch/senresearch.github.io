## Interactive visualizations

These use Julia's Pluto notebooks.

### Diagnostic tests

- [Diagnostic tests: prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and
   predictive values](http://pluto.genenetwork.org/disease-testing.html) How
   the postive/negative predictive values of a diagnostic test based
   on a quantitative measurement behave.
- [Diagnostic test with a varying
  cutoff](http://pluto.genenetwork.org/roc.html) Shows how varying the cutoff
  point for a quantitative diagnostic test can affect sensitivity and
  specificity.

### Probability and simulations

- [Coin flip simulator](http://pluto.genenetwork.org/flips.html) Simulates
   what would happen if you flipped a coin a bunch of times, and kept
   a running tally of the proportion of heads.
- [Common distributions](http://pluto.genenetwork.org/distributions.html)
   Simulator of common probability distributions as you vary the
   parameters of those distributions.
- [Central Limit Theorem](http://pluto.genenetwork.org/clt.html) Illustrates
  the Central Limit Theorem by visualizing the histogram of the sample
  mean for different distribution and sample sizes.
- [Probability rules and Bayes
  Theorem](http://pluto.genenetwork.org/bayes.html) Graphical illustration of
  Bayes Theorem.

### Power and sample size

- [How power depends on effect size, sample size, and the desired
false positive rate](http://pluto.genenetwork.org/power .html) Interactive
visualization of impact of effect size and sample size on power.

### Optimization techniques

- [How the L1-penalty achieves
  sparsity](http://pluto.genenetwork.org/L1-penalty.html) Illustration of how
  minimizing a quadratic loss function with an L1 penalty helps
  acheive sparsity.
- [How the proximal operator works](http://pluto.genenetwork.org/prox.html)
  Illustration of the proximal operator used in optimization.
